### App metrics
The key user events for our app are:

- create organization account

- create newsroom
- publish a news release
- add / update contacts
- send email about release (create 1 or multiple)
- login
- create clipping of news
- make payment
- upgrade / downgrade account
- delete account


### Public metrics

The key events for visitors to public newsrooms are:

- news release activity 
- open / click on email (measured through Mandrill)

### Automatic metrics

Some events are triggered by time or other external factors:

- revenue event (recognized revenue - usually triggered by user buying a new account / upgrading account)
- credit card expired (incl. downgrade account)
